## Desktop version

{% include download_button.html %}

This is the latest version of the desktop version of OpenRocket. It contains the latest and greatest features, and runs on any system supporting Java.

OpenRocket can be started in most graphical environments (including Windows) by double-clicking the package icon. No installation is required.

From the command line OpenRocket can be started by `java -jar
OpenRocket-15.03.jar`


## Android version

The Android version allows opening OpenRocket files, viewing simulations and motors. Later versions will allow running simulations as well.

The Android version is thanks to the fantastic work by Kevin Ruland.
